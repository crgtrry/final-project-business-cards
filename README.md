# Business cards

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.4.
Its a final project for CSC 436

Still left to work
* imaging capturing: mostly done but ran out of time.  The text is returned and the data is extracted, but putting it into the final review process is failing on an unhandled exception.  Feel this is an easy remedy but calling it.
* Selecting a card off the list, edit card was not implemented.
* Do not filter list of cards on 'owner'... everyone can see other users' cards.
* Using a modal to capture image but it does not close after initiating processing.  User must click off it for it to go away.
* Some redirection is not working
* Some CSS work is necessary
